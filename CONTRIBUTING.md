# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please follow it in all of your interactions with the project.

## Development environment


`earthaccess` is a Python library that uses Poetry to build and publish the package to PyPI, the defacto Python repository. In order to develop new features or patch bugs etc. we need to set up a virtual environment and install the library locally. We can accomplish this with both Poetry or/and Conda.

### Using Conda

If we have `mamba` (or `conda`) installed, we can use the environment file included in the `ci` folder. This will install all the libraries we need (including Poetry) to start developing `earthaccess`:

```bash
mamba env update -f ci/environment-dev.yml
mamba activate earthaccess-dev
poetry install
```

After activating our environment and installing the library with Poetry we can run Jupyter lab and start testing the local distribution or we can use `make` to run the tests and lint the code.
Now we can create a feature branch and push those changes to our fork!

### Using Poetry

If we want to use Poetry, first we need to [install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). After installing Poetry we can use the same workflow we used for Conda, first we install the library locally:

```bash
poetry install
```

and now we can run the local Jupyter Lab and run the scripts etc. using Poetry:

```bash
poetry run jupyter lab
```

### Managing Dependencies

If you need to add a dependency, you should do the following:

- Run `poetry add <package>` for a required (non-development) dependency
- Run `poetry add --group=dev <package>` for a development dependency, such
  as a testing or code analysis dependency

Both commands will add an entry to `pyproject.toml` with a version that is
compatible with the rest of the dependencies.  However, `poetry` pins versions
with a caret (`^`), which is not what we want.  Therefore, you must locate the
new entry in `pyproject.toml` and change the `^` to `>=`.  (See
[poetry-relax](https://github.com/zanieb/poetry-relax) for the reasoning behind
this.)

In addition, you must also add a corresponding entry to
`ci/environment-mindeps.yaml`.  You'll notice in that file that required
dependencies should be pinned exactly to the versions specified in
`pyproject.toml` (after changing `^` to `>=` there), and that development
dependencies should be left unpinned.

Finally, for _development dependencies only_, you must add an entry to
`ci/environment-dev.yaml` with the same version constraint as in
`pyproject.toml`.

## First Steps to fix an issue or bug

- Read the documentation (working on adding more)
- create the minimally reproducible issue
- try to edit the relevant code and see if it fixes it
- submit the fix to the problem as a pull request
- include an explanation of what you did and why

## First steps to contribute new features

- Create an issue to discuss the feature's scope and its fit for this package
- run pytest to ensure your local version of code passes all unit tests
- try to edit the relevant code and implement your new feature in a backwards compatible manner
- create new tests as you go, and run the test suite as you go
- update the documentation as you go

### Please format and lint as you go

```bash
make format lint
```

### Requirements to merge code (Pull Request Process)

- you must include test coverage
- you must update the documentation
- you must run the command above to format and lint

## Pull Request process

1. Ensure you include test coverage for all changes
1. Ensure your code is formatted properly following this document
1. Update the documentation and the `README.md` with details of changes to the
   interface, this includes new environment variables, function names,
   decorators, etc.
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with details about your change in a section titled
   `Unreleased`. If one does not exist, please create one.
1. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of another
   developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the
   reviewer to merge it for you.

## Release process

> :memo: The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/). Note that until
> we agree we're ready for v1.0.0, we will not increment the major version.

1. Ensure all desired features are merged to `main` branch and `CHANGELOG.md` is updated.
1. Use `bump-my-version` to increase the version number in all needed places, e.g. to
   increase the minor version (`1.2.3` to `1.3.0`):

   ```plain
   bump-my-version bump minor
   ```

1. Push a tag on the new commit containing the version number, prefixed with `v`, e.g.
   `v1.3.0`.
1. [Create a new GitHub Release](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/releases/new). We
   hand-curate our release notes to be valuable to humans. Please do not auto-generate
   release notes and aim for consistency with the GitHub Release descriptions from other
   releases.

> :gear: After the GitHub release is published, multiple automations will trigger:
>
> - Zenodo will create a new DOI.
> - GitHub Actions will publish a PyPI release.

> :memo: `earthaccess` is published to conda-forge through the
> [earthdata-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/earthdata-feedstock), as this
> project was renamed early in its life. The conda package is named `earthaccess`.
